The Old Salt River Haunted Forest, a Halloween attraction which has been organized by volunteers during the last few years, is being cancelled this year due to flooding caused by the recent rainy weather.

Haunted Forest organizer Shannon Wilcox wrote on her Facebook page:
<blockquote>“Well this was a tough decision but due to all the rain we are going to have to cancel our event this year. The rain has caused the river to flood and the area we do the Haunted Forest is under water. We have decided we are still going to donate a portion of our current fund balance to Adri and if anyone does have donations they would like to donate to Fosters Closet I am happy to collect and deliver them. Please share so we can get the word out to everyone. Thank you.”</blockquote>
