<h2>What is it?</h2>
Trunk or Treat is an event where residents park their cars on either side of Wright Avenue between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and hand out candy to kids. It’s a fun addition to the tradition of trick or treating. In addition to being safe, easy fun for the kids who attend, the participants who park their vehicles have fun by decorating their trunks and dressing up.
<h2>What time does it start?</h2>
The event will take place from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Halloween Night, in conjunction with Trick or Treating around the Village.
<h2>Anything else I should know?</h2>
The event is hosted by the Shepherd Chamber of Commerce. They’re also looking for participants. Anybody who is interested should call 828-5278 to reserve their spot.

The event will also feature a Haunted School Bus.
<h2>The Gist</h2>
This is great wholesome fun for the whole family. If you have little ones who perhaps are not as interested in walking all over town, this is a great way to give them a taste of what Halloween is like without over exerting themselves. Or, as a parent if you’re not interested in a lot of walking, this is a nice alternative.

It pays to arrive early, because lines form up quickly and then you will find yourself spending more time standing around than actually getting candy or visiting houses.
