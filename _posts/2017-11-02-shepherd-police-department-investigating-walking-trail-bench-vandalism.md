The Shepherd Police Department is currently searching for the individuals who defaced the benches which sit alongside the Shepherd Trail. Chief Sawyer posted on October 31:
<blockquote>WE NEED YOUR HELP...

This morning we were notified that several of the benches on the walk trail (beside the RR tracks) were vandalized with graffiti. I have attached several edited pictures. It seems as though our Department is not at the top of their Christmas list as one says...F***K Shepherd PoPo's and another says F***K Sawyer.

It is believed this took place within the past 24 hours. This area of the trail is directly across from the playground on Federal Road.

A private citizen has offered a $250 reward for the identification and prosecution of the person or persons.

If you have any knowledge of this incident you can call our office at 989-828-5045 or e-mail lsawyer@villageofshepherd.org.

It is unfortunate when some misguided individuals (putting it in nice terms...this is a family page) decide to destroy property of others. Let's make a statement that this WILL NOT be tolerated in our community!
