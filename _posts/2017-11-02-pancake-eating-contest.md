Come and enjoy the fun as you eat as many pancakes as you can in eight minutes! Prizes awarded to all who enter the contest.

The Pancake Eating Contest will be held on Sunday, April 29, 2018 at 9 a.m. as a part of the 2018 Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival. The contest will take place under a tent in front of the Shepherd High School. In the case of bad weather, it will be moved into the high school cafeteria.

There is no cost to enter the contest.

Volunteers will be needed to help transport pancakes to the event, and then help with clean up.
