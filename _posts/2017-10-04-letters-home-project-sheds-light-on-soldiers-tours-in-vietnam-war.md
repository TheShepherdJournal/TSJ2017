<h2>The Story</h2>
WCMU Public Media and Mid Michigan Community College Student Veterans of America are working together on a “Letters Home Wall.” The exhibit will consist of Vietnam War veterans’ letters, diary excerpts, photos, and audio clips.
<h2>How to contribute</h2>
Veterans are being invited to send copies of their materials to <a href="mailto:linda.dielman@cmich.edu">linda.dielman@cmich.edu</a>. Anybody who needs assistance with scanning their materials can visit their local library or Veteran Affairs office.
<h2>Contribute Audio</h2>
WCMU Public Media will be traveling to several cities to record veterans or family members reading their letters out loud. The recordings will air on WCMU Public Media and reside on wcmu.org.
<h2>Visit the Wall</h2>
The “Letters Home Wall” will be available to travel to others’ events throughout the state. After its tour throughout central and northern Michigan, it will become a part of the permanent collection in the Michigan Military Heritage Museum in Grass Lake Mi.
