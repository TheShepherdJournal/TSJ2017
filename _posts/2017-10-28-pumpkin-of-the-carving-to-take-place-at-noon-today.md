On Friday, Roth and others were preparing to 1500 pumpkins for Saturday’s community pumpkin carving event. The event, which starts at noon today (Saturday, October 28) will turn every pumpkin into a decorative jack-o-lantern. The carved pumpkins will line Roth’s yard.

The event will take place at 109 North Second Street.

Drills are used to cut holes into the bottom of each pumpkin so that they could be emptied.
