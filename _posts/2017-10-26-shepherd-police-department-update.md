<i>From the Shepherd Police Department:</i>

Good morning everyone! Just a few quick reminders...

"Stuff Officer Janofski's Office" for the Foster Closet of Isabella County is going on until November 16th. We are collecting men's sized socks for teenage boys, feminine products, coloring books and crayons. Let's make sure that no child goes without!

We will have our police car at the Winn Fall Fest on Friday from 4-8PM. Chief Sawyer and Sheriff Main have been tasked with grilling the hot dogs. This is an awesome family event!

We are hosting our Women's Self Defense Seminar on Saturday at the Shepherd High School. We have 82...yes, you read that correct 82 women signed up. This is going to be a fun and informative time.

On November 16th, Chief Sawyer will be putting on his dancing shoes as he performs (we are using the word very loosely) at Dance United. This is a fundraiser for the United Way of Gratiot and Isabella Counties. 100% of the money raised is going directly back into our community!

Have a great day!!!
