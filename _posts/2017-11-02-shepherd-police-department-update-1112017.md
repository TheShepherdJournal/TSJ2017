<p><i>From the Shepherd Police Department</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good morning everyone! 2 quick things....</p>
<ul>
<li>Our October stats have been completed and we responded to 48 calls for service. With the deer running it should come as no surprise that accidents were our #1 category for the month. They are sneaky...so keep alert! We performed 39 traffic stops and issued 30 verbal warnings.</li>
<li>We are checking leads into our graffiti case. Another resident dropped off $30 to add to the reward, so it is now $280 to the identification and prosecution of the individual(s) responsible. Thank you for all of your help as well sharing the post. FB is an incredible tool used by law enforcement all over the country to quickly get a message out to the masses. Unfortunately some completely miss that point...but it's okay!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great day!</p>
<p>Chief Sawyer</p>
