An Open house will be held for the new Eight 2 Eight Rental Hall from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, November 19.

Eight 2 Eight owners Will and Staci wrote on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/156978105041873/">Facebook event for the open house</a>, “We are hosting our open house for our community to see what we have put together for you. We will have some of our resources there to get acquainted with their services as well. We look forward to sharing our accomplishment with you all. Hope to see you all on the 19th.”
