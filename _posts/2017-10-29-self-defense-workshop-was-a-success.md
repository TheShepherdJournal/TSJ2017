From the Shepherd Police Department

Hey everybody! We had an awesome day of Women's Self-Defense at our Seminar. I don't have the actual sheet in front of me, but we had approximately 70 participants...Ages 16 to upper 60's. A huge thank you to the school for the venue and to our instructors from Central Michigan Karate.

We are already put together plans for our next seminar in the spring.
