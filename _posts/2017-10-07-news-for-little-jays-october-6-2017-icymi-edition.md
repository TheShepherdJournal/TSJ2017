<h2>Shepherd Elementary School Tips</h2>
<h3>Homework requests</h3>
If your student will be out of school for a day and you need to make arrangements to have missed assignments sent home, it is best to call the main office before 11 a.m. This gives the teachers time to compile the homework assignments before the end of the school day.
<h3>Outside Dress</h3>
It is that time of year when the weather gets a little cooler, especially in the morning during recess. Remember to send a jacket or warm sweatshirt with your student so they can stay warm.
<h3>Change in After School Plans</h3>
If you need to communicate a change in after school plans, then it is important to follow the procedure below:
<ul>
 	<li>Changes must be into the office by 12 p.m.</li>
 	<li>Changes can be communicated by note or phone, but if you do it by phone you should follow up with an email or fax message sent to the main office</li>
 	<li>Don’t email teachers with changes in after school plans, as they need to go through the office.</li>
</ul>
