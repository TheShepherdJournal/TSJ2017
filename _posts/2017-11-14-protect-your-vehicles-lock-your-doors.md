Just a reminder to always be vigilant about the protection of your property, especially your vehicles if you park them outside. "Thieves are looking for one primary thing when they steal from vehicles," a post written on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1727813280570566&amp;id=205632619455314">Shepherd Police Department Facebook page</a> said. "Remember it is not 1985 anymore." The SPD encouraged residents to remain proactive about preventing crime.
