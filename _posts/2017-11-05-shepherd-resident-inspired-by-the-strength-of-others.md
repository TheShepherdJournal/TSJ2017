Hey There Life...

You have been messing with me a lot lately... started to get me down yesterday...

See that early morning visit to the ER due to gurgling in my lungs and having trouble breathing due to constant coughing and mucus had me exhausted...

But a breathing treatment and a LOT of meds and I was home safe and warm trying to ride out the severe bronchitis as they put it...

That lasted almost two hours...

Then my stomach said, “Hello! Did you miss me?”

I felt the pain start and immediately told my wife... within 15 minutes headed back to the ER... doubled over in pain as if someone had reached inside my stomach... grabbed the lining and twisted it as hard as they could...

It was worse than ever...

Waiting was excruciating... I walked and I sat and I crouched and I knelt... tried everything, but this was the worst it had ever been... including the nausea and dizziness...

So... I was desperate... looking for anything... something to ease the pain when my favorite quote dawned on me...

“My Life is not defined by what happens to me. It is how I react to it that defines me.”

I knew what to do...

I remembered my time spent with Darren ‘Birdy’ Wiles and Kara Spindler and how they battled the pain... their spirits...
<ul>
 	<li>I thought of my dear friend Melinda Chard Waffle who battled pain so inspiringly and shared it in a blog for others to draw strength from....</li>
 	<li>Dan Christensen and his war on pain and that fighting spirit inside him that refuses to ever yield...</li>
 	<li>Most recently Adriana Nelson and her pain and the battle within... always showing that smile... and fighting on.</li>
</ul>
I focused on them and the unimaginable pain they must endure... I saw their faces and their smiles and remembered things about each...

And while I focused... my pain subsided for a bit... was eased... to the point I almost felt ashamed to even think of comparing mine to theirs...

So with those thoughts and faces in my mind and as the morphine drip went in and the stomach ‘cocktail’ they call it worked its magic...

Life... whatever you throw at me... I can find strength to battle....

I have learned and been inspired by some of the very best...
