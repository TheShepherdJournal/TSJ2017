Our track trip to Myrtle Beach gives athletes a safe and chaperoned spring break trip while also allowing them a chance to work hard and gain great fitness for the upcoming season. It is a great experience for all who want to work hard to go. Please follow the link to Register and find out more info on each race! Hope to see you there and thank you for supporting Shepherd Track and Field and Cross Country!
