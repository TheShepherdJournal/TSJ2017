The profile image for <em>The Shepherd Journal </em>Facebook page has gone dark in honor of the passing of a former Shepherd resident, Jennifer Ritter. For me, I will remember Jenny as a former neighbor, a former co-worker and, most all, a good friend.

Visitation, a memorial service, and luncheon have been scheduled for October 11 at the First Church of Christ on 1610 E. Broadway, Mount Pleasant. Here is the schedule:
<ul>
 	<li>Visitation with the family - 10 a.m.</li>
 	<li>Memorial Service - 11 a.m.</li>
 	<li>Luncheon - Following the Memorial Service</li>
</ul>
During the time that I've had to reflect on the impact Jenny had on my life, I've thought a lot about how she was always willing to help someone in need.  One year, when I mentioned that I wanted to throw a surprise birthday party for my wife, Theresa, Jenny offered to bake a birthday cake without hesitation. She was also always willing to watch the kids if we needed someone to babysit.

She will be missed.
