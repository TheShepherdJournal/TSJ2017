The Shepherd Police Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1727695993915628&amp;id=205632619455314">announced the S.Y.R.U.P. winners for October</a>. The SPD described the S.Y.R.U.P.:

“Operation S.Y.R.U.P. is a program we began last year in the Shepherd Middle School. The goal is to recognize those that exhibit great citizenship, integrity, willingness to help others and just be an overall great kid. In society we often recognize great athletic performance or even honor role grades...but often miss what we believe is most important...being a good person.”

The winners are:
<ul>
 	<li>6th grade: Alexis, Jalen and Makayla</li>
 	<li>7th grade: Elle, Clay and Andrew</li>
 	<li>8th: Konnor, Kiersten and Blake</li>
</ul>
