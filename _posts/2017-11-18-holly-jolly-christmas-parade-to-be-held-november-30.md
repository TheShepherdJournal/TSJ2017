<h2>Checking his List</h2>
Santa Claus will be a big feature of the Holly Jolly Parade scheduled to start at 5:45 p.m. on November 30. The parade will travel from Chippewa street, to Wright, and then First street where the parade will end.
<h2>Checking it Twice</h2>
Santa Claus will then be available between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. to visit with children in front of the Shepherd Park. Hot Cocoa and cookies will also be served by the Rotary Club. Donations of animal toys or dog food, or teddy bears will be accepted throughout the event.
<h2>The Gist</h2>
This is going to be a fun night for the whole family. In past years, there have been live music presented by the high school choir, and an opportunity to experience the villageâ€™s decorations while they are lit up at night. The event is a great way to kick off the holiday season.
