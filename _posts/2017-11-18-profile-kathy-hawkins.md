“Kathy is the wonderful, warm presence that will greet you when you stop by the Shepherd office. She will be on the phone with you to set up appointments, answer any questions, and assist with services throughout the process, always with a smile.

Kathy has an incredible family that she loves spending her time with. To her, there is nothing better than a house full of life, laughter, and the little feet of her five grand-kids running around. She spends time traveling with her husband to visit family when they aren't able to come home to her and to explore new places. Kathy is also very involved with the Shepherd community, you can see her at many of the events hosted in town, she takes her warm, kind, and welcoming personality with her wherever she goes.”
