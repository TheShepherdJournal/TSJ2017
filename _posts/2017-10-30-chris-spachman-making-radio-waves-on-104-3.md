Hey There Shepherd...

Shepherd Alum Chris Spachman is attacking life and making ‘radio’ waves! (He is a DJ... Get it?)

I’ve been listening to him on 104.3 and he is fresh, excited, and fun to listen to!
If you want to give a listen, Chris is on 3 to 8 weekdays, and 10 to 3 on Saturday and Sunday (those are usually pre recorded)...

Very nice work Mr. Spachman!
